## Choosing a firmware

There are currently two options regarding firmware which can be used.

### My custom firmware
  This is a peace of software designed by eplop which has built in wifi configuration as well as allowing you to push the data to a MQTT server as well as an influxDB.  The software also natively integrates with Home Assistant.

### ESPHome
  This will require one slight modification to the hardware but is a great way to connect.
